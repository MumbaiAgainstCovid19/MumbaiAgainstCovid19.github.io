Dear Mumbaikar,

Greetings from **Physician Volunteers for Telephonic Guidance on Covid-19**. 

We are a voluntary group of Mumbai doctors headed by Dr Tushar Shah, MD Physician. We are available for telephonic guidance with respect to Covid-19, the infection caused by the new Coronavirus. 

We will be GUIDING you and will NOT be treating you on the phone. We will prefer WhatsApp as the mode of messaging and calling. Before calling do send your name and age by WhatsApp. 

This is an absolutely free service. One reason for doing this is that you do not rush unnecessarily to a clinic or hospital and therefore come in contact with other patients.

Another reason is to guide you to the correct medical facility if you need testing for the virus or need treatment. 

We will also help you with instructions regarding hygiene, self-isolation and other safety procedures. 

We are doing this purely as a service and will not be held responsible for the decisions you make based on our guidance.

Dr Tushar Shah, MD. (Consulting Physician) 

17th March 2020.
